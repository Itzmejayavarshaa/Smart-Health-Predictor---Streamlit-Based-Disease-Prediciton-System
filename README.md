# Smart-Health-Predictor---Streamlit-Based-Disease-Prediciton-System
Smart Health Predictor - Streamlit Based Disease Prediciton System

Project Description:
Smart Health Predictor is an intelligent web/mobile-based system designed to assist users in understanding and managing their health by predicting potential diseases based on symptoms. Leveraging machine learning and data analytics, the system allows users to input various health symptoms and personal information (like age, gender, etc.), and it provides predictive insights about possible health conditions, along with suggested next steps.The primary objective of this project is to empower individuals with preliminary health assessments and encourage timely medical consultation. By utilizing a trained model on medical datasets, the system achieves high prediction accuracy and offers a user-friendly interface for both patients and healthcare providers.

Key Features:

Symptom-based disease prediction using machine learning algorithms
Interactive and user-friendly interface for symptom input
Predictive results with disease probability and severity insights
Recommendations for specialist doctors or next steps
Optionally, integration with health APIs or wearable devices
Admin dashboard for managing disease/symptom datasets (if applicable)

Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (optional)
Backend: Python (Flask/Django)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Database: MySQL / MongoDB / Firebase
Model: Decision Tree / Random Forest / Naive Bayes (or custom ML model)
Optional: Android app (Java/Kotlin), REST API, cloud deployment

Use Cases:

Early detection of common illnesses
Helping users decide when to seek medical help
Reducing unnecessary clinic visits through remote screening
Enhancing telemedicine services
